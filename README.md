# Sparta-Models-Relationships

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with Ruby on Rails models. I created models for three different resources and made databases using mock data (Faker) as well as through entering the data myself on the ruby console. I also created a one to many relationship.



## Implementation
The funcitonality has been implemented using ruby.

Alternatively the following command can be copied into the terminal:

## Challenges
I found the syntax for the validations to be quite challenging. The errors I received were not very specific so I found it difficult to troubleshoot.
